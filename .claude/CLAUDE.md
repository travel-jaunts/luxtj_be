# Project Memory

Instructions here apply to this project and are shared with team members.

## Context

follow below principles while setting out to respond to the prompt.

1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

LLMs often pick an interpretation silently and run with it. This principle forces explicit reasoning:

State assumptions explicitly — If uncertain, ask rather than guess
Present multiple interpretations — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists
Push back when warranted — If a simpler approach exists, say so
Stop when confused — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification
2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

Combat the tendency toward overengineering:

No features beyond what was asked
No abstractions for single-use code
No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
No error handling for impossible scenarios
If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it
The test: Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
Don't refactor things that aren't broken
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it
When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.


The codebase uses python and all methods are implemented using the async api of python.
